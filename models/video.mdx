## Model Types

- **Text to Video:** Generate videos from text prompts
- **Image to Video:** Animate static images into video clips

<Note>
Video generation uses an async queue system. See the [Video Queue API](/api-reference/endpoint/video/queue) to start generation and [Video Retrieve API](/api-reference/endpoint/video/retrieve) to fetch results.
</Note>

## Pricing

Each model card shows the **per-second rate** which updates when you change resolution in the dropdown. For models with resolution-based pricing, selecting different resolutions will show the corresponding rate.

For exact quotes before submitting a job, use the [Video Quote API](/api-reference/endpoint/video/quote).

<Note>
All prices are in USD. Diem users pay the same rates (1 Diem = $1 of compute per day).
