## Eliza Instructions

To setup Eliza with Venice, follow these instructions. A full blog post with more detail can be found [here](https://venice.ai/blog/how-to-build-a-social-media-ai-agent-with-elizaos-venice-api).

* Clone the Eliza repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ai16z/eliza.git
```

* Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

* Update `.env` specifying your `VENICE_API_KEY`, and model selections for  `SMALL_VENICE_MODEL`, `MEDIUM_VENICE_MODEL`, `LARGE_VENICE_MODEL`, `IMAGE_VENICE_MODEL`, instructions on generating your key can be found [here](/welcome/guides/generating-api-key).

* Create a new character in the `/characters/` folder with a filename similar to  `your_character.character.json`to specify the character profile, tools/functions, and Venice.ai as the model provider:

```typescript
   modelProvider: "venice"
```

* Build the repo:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

* Start your character

```bash
pnpm start --characters="characters/<your_character>.character.json"
```

* Start the local UI to chat with the agent
