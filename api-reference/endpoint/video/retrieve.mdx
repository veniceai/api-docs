## Overview
Retrieve the result of a video generation request. If the video is still processing, the response will include the current status and estimated time remaining. Once complete, the video file will be returned directly as an MP4.

## Response Types
- **Processing**: Returns a JSON object with `status: "PROCESSING"`, `average_execution_time`, and `execution_duration`
- **Complete**: Returns the video file as `video/mp4`

## Auto-Delete
Set `delete_media_on_completion` to `true` in your request to automatically delete the video from storage after retrieval, eliminating the need to call `/video/complete`.
