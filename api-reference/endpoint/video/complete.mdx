## Overview
Delete a video generation request from storage after it has been successfully downloaded. This is useful for cleaning up resources when you're done with a video.

## Alternative
Instead of calling this endpoint separately, you can set `delete_media_on_completion` to `true` when calling `/video/retrieve` to automatically delete the video after retrieval.
