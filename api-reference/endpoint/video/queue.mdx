## Overview
Queue a new video generation request. Video generation is an asynchronous process that takes time to complete, so you'll receive a `queue_id` that you can use to check the status and retrieve the completed video.

## Workflow
1. Call `/video/queue` to submit your video generation request
2. Use the returned `queue_id` to poll `/video/retrieve` until the video is ready
3. Once complete, the video will be returned as an MP4 file
4. Optionally call `/video/complete` to clean up the video from storage
