## Default Limits

### Text Models

Text models are grouped into tiers based on size. Each model card on the [Models page](/models/text) displays its tier badge.

| Tier | Requests/min | Tokens/min |
|:-----|-------------:|-----------:|
| XS | 500 | 1,000,000 |
| S | 75 | 750,000 |
| M | 50 | 750,000 |
| L | 20 | 500,000 |

<Accordion title="Which models are in each tier?">

**XS** `qwen3-4b` `llama-3.2-3b`

**S** `mistral-31-24b` `venice-uncensored`

**M** `llama-3.3-70b` `qwen3-next-80b` `google-gemma-3-27b-it`

**L** `qwen3-235b` `qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507` `qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507` `deepseek-ai-DeepSeek-R1` `grok-41-fast` `kimi-k2-thinking` `gemini-3-pro-preview` `hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b` `qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct` `zai-org-glm-4.6` `openai-gpt-oss-120b`

### Other Models

| Type | Requests/min |
|:-----|-------------:|
| Image | 20 |
| Audio | 60 |
| Embedding | 500 |
| Video (queue) | 20 |
| Video (retrieve) | 120 |

## Handling Errors

Failed requests (500, 503, 429) should be retried with exponential backoff.

For 429 errors specifically, check the `x-ratelimit-reset-requests` header for the exact Unix timestamp when you can retry. Most HTTP libraries have built-in retry mechanisms that handle this automatically.

### Abuse Protection

If you generate more than 20 failed requests in 30 seconds, the API will block further requests for 30 seconds:

```
Too many failed attempts (> 20) resulting in a non-success status code. Please wait 30s and try again.
```

## Response Headers

Every response includes these headers:

| Header | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `x-ratelimit-limit-requests` | Max requests allowed in current window |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests` | Requests remaining in current window |
| `x-ratelimit-reset-requests` | Unix timestamp when window resets |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens` | Max tokens allowed per minute |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens` | Tokens remaining in current minute |
| `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens` | Seconds until token limit resets |

## Partner Tier

Partners get significantly higher rate limits:

| Tier | Requests/min | Tokens/min |
|:-----|-------------:|-----------:|
| XS | 500 | 2,000,000 |
| S | 150 | 1,500,000 |
| M | 100 | 1,500,000 |
| L | 60 | 1,000,000 |

| Type | Requests/min |
|:-----|-------------:|
| Image | 60 |
| Audio | 120 |
| Embedding | 500 |

If you're consistently hitting your rate limits and your usage patterns show **sustained demand over time**, reach out to discuss partner access: [api@venice.ai](mailto:api@venice.ai).

Partner tier limits can be adjusted based on your specific needs.
