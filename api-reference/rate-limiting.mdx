Rate limits vary by model and tier. You can check your exact limits anytime:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="View Your Limits" icon="gauge-high" href="/api-reference/endpoint/api_keys/rate_limits?playground=open">
    Interactive playground
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rate Limit Logs" icon="clock-rotate-left" href="/api-reference/endpoint/api_keys/rate_limit_logs?playground=open">
    See which requests hit limits
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

```bash
curl https://api.venice.ai/api/v1/api_keys/rate_limits \

```

## Default Limits

### Text Models

Text models are grouped into tiers based on size. Each model card on the [Models page](/models/text) displays its tier badge.

| Tier | Requests/min | Tokens/min |
|:-----|-------------:|-----------:|
| XS | 500 | 1,000,000 |
| S | 75 | 750,000 |
| M | 50 | 750,000 |
| L | 20 | 500,000 |

### Other Models

| Type | Requests/min |
|:-----|-------------:|
| Image | 20 |
| Audio | 60 |
| Embedding | 500 |
| Video (queue) | 20 |
| Video (retrieve) | 120 |

## Handling Errors

Failed requests (500, 503, 429) should be retried with exponential backoff.

For 429 errors specifically, check the `x-ratelimit-reset-requests` header for the exact Unix timestamp when you can retry. Most HTTP libraries have built-in retry mechanisms that handle this automatically.

### Abuse Protection

If you generate more than 20 failed requests in 30 seconds, the API will block further requests for 30 seconds:

```
Too many failed attempts (> 20) resulting in a non-success status code. Please wait 30s and try again.
```

## Response Headers

Every response includes these headers:

| Header | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `x-ratelimit-limit-requests` | Max requests allowed in current window |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests` | Requests remaining in current window |
| `x-ratelimit-reset-requests` | Unix timestamp when window resets |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens` | Max tokens allowed per minute |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens` | Tokens remaining in current minute |
| `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens` | Seconds until token limit resets |

## Partner Tier

Partners get significantly higher rate limits:

| Tier | Requests/min | Tokens/min |
|:-----|-------------:|-----------:|
| XS | 500 | 2,000,000 |
| S | 150 | 1,500,000 |
| M | 100 | 1,500,000 |
| L | 60 | 1,000,000 |

| Type | Requests/min |
|:-----|-------------:|
| Image | 60 |
| Audio | 120 |
| Embedding | 500 |

If you're **consistently** hitting your rate limits and need more capacity, reach out to discuss partner access:
- Email [support@venice.ai](mailto:support@venice.ai)
- Post in #API on [Discord](https://discord.gg/venice)

We're looking for consistency here. If your usage patterns show sustained demand over time, we can work with you on partner tier access.
