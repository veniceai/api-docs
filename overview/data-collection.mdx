This page describes what data Venice collects when you use the API or the web app, and how that data is used. Venice does not collect prompt content, model responses, or generated media. For details on how that works, see [Privacy](/overview/privacy).

For more information, see the [Venice Privacy Policy](https://venice.ai/legal/privacy-policy).

## API usage metadata

Each API request generates operational metadata used for billing, rate limiting, and platform health. This metadata does not include prompt or response content.

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Token counts (input/output) | `512 in, 1024 out` | Billing |
| Model ID | `zai-org-glm-4.7` | Billing and routing |
| Request timestamp | `2026-02-20T15:30:00Z` | Rate limiting |
| Response latency | `1.2s` | Performance monitoring |
| HTTP status code | `200` | Error tracking |
| API key identifier | `vk_...abc` | Authentication and billing |

## Account information

What Venice stores depends on your account type:

| Account type | Data collected |
|---|---|
| No account | Basic metadata: timezone, browser type, IP address. Used for abuse prevention and experience optimization. |
| Free account | Email address for account verification, or public wallet address if signing up with a crypto wallet. |
| Pro account | Credit card payments are processed by [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and never shared with Venice. Crypto payments record only the public wallet address. |

Each tier includes the data from the tiers above it.

<Tip>
Use a VPN to mask your IP address. Use a disposable email or a web3 wallet to avoid sharing your real email.
</Tip>

## Product telemetry

Venice logs product usage events such as sign-ins, chat creation, chat deletion, and filter changes. These events describe actions you take on the platform, not the content of those actions.

## Third-party services

| Service | Purpose | Data shared |
|---|---|---|
| [Stripe](https://stripe.com) | Credit card payments | Card details (not shared with Venice) |
| [Clerk](https://clerk.com) | Email authentication | Email address |
| WalletConnect | Web3 login | Public wallet address |
| [Customer.io](https://customer.io) | Email communications and event tracking | Email address, product events |
| [Plausible](https://plausible.io) | Privacy-friendly analytics | Page views (no cookies, no personal data) |
