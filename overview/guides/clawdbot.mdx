[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) is an open-source, self-hosted AI gateway that connects messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, Slack) to AI models. Venice AI is available as a built-in provider, giving you access to private and uncensored models from any connected channel.

## Setup

### 1. Install OpenClaw

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install -g openclaw@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Run the onboarding wizard

```bash
openclaw onboard --auth-choice venice-api-key
```

The wizard will prompt you for your Venice API key. Get one from [venice.ai/settings/api](https://venice.ai/settings/api) if you don't have one yet.

You can also set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export VENICE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### 3. Pick a model

During onboarding, OpenClaw shows all available Venice models. Some recommendations:

| Use case | Model | Privacy |
|---|---|---|
| General (flagship) | `venice/zai-org-glm-4.7` | Private |
| Best quality | `venice/claude-opus-45` | Anonymized |
| Coding | `venice/qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct` | Private |
| Vision | `venice/qwen3-vl-235b-a22b` | Private |
| Uncensored | `venice/venice-uncensored` | Private |
| Fast and cheap | `venice/qwen3-4b` | Private |

Change your default model anytime:

```bash
openclaw models set venice/zai-org-glm-4.7
```

List all available models:

```bash
openclaw models list | grep venice
```

### 4. Start chatting

Open the terminal UI:

```bash
openclaw tui
```

Or the web dashboard:

```bash
openclaw dashboard
```

Or connect a messaging channel (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, etc.):

```bash
openclaw channels login
openclaw gateway
```

## Privacy modes

Venice models in OpenClaw follow the same [privacy tiers](/overview/privacy) as the Venice API:

- **Private** models (GLM, Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama, Venice Uncensored) run on Venice's GPU fleet. Prompts are never stored or logged.
- **Anonymized** models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok) are proxied through Venice with all identifying information stripped. The third-party provider sees Venice as the customer, not you.

## Image and video generation

Install the Venice AI Media skill for image and video generation:

```bash
openclaw skills install nhannah/venice-ai-media
```
