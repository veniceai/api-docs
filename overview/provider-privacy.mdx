Venice serves models through two infrastructure paths, each with different data handling characteristics. Every model on the [pricing page](/overview/pricing) and in the [model catalog](/models/overview) is labeled with its privacy tier.

For an overview of how requests are processed and Venice's own retention policy, see [Privacy](/overview/privacy).

## Private models

Private models run on Venice's GPU fleet using open-source models. Requests do not leave Venice's infrastructure and no third party is involved in processing. Zero Data Retention applies end-to-end.

The GPU receives only the raw prompt context. No user ID, IP address, or account information is forwarded.

**Examples:** Venice Uncensored, GLM 4.7, Qwen 3, DeepSeek V3.2, Llama 3.3, Mistral, Kokoro TTS

## Anonymized models

Anonymized models are served by third-party providers. Venice acts as an anonymizing proxy, stripping all identifying information before forwarding requests.

Venice removes your API key, IP address, headers, and all account data. The anonymized request is forwarded to the provider under Venice's own credentials. The provider sees Venice as the customer, not you.

Venice does not log or store any prompt or response content from these requests. However, the provider's own retention and training policies apply to the anonymized request.

**Examples:** Claude Opus/Sonnet, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, Grok 4.1

## Provider policies

Each third-party provider has its own data handling policies for training and retention. The table below reflects the current policies as they apply to API requests.

| Provider | Models on Venice | Trains on data | Retains data | Retention period | Policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | Claude Opus 4.5/4.6, Sonnet 4.5/4.6 | No | Yes (default) | Up to 30 days. ZDR-eligible with arrangement. | [Privacy center](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/7996866-how-long-do-you-store-my-organization-s-data) |

| xAI | Grok 4.1 Fast, Grok Code Fast 1 | No | Yes | 30 days (auto-deleted) | [Enterprise FAQ](https://x.ai/legal/faq-enterprise) |

| MiniMax | MiniMax M2.1, M2.5 | Not documented | Yes | 90 days (API logs) | [Privacy policy](https://minimaxm2.io/privacy) |

<Note>
Provider policies can change. Where Venice is unable to establish a clear policy for a provider, the table reflects that. Venice works with providers to maintain privacy-respecting arrangements but cannot guarantee their policies long-term.
