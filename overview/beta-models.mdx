We sometimes release models in beta to gather feedback and confirm their performance before a full production rollout. Beta models are available to all users but are **not recommended for production use**.

Beta status does not guarantee promotion to production. A beta model may be removed if it is too costly to run, performs poorly at scale, or raises safety concerns. Beta models can change without notice and may have limited documentation or support. Models that prove stable, broadly useful, and aligned with our standards are promoted to general availability.

## Important Considerations

When using beta models, keep in mind:

- May be changed or removed at any time without the standard deprecation notice period
- Not suitable for production applications or critical workflows
- May have inconsistent performance, availability, or behavior
- Limited or no migration support if removed
- Best used for testing, evaluation, and experimental projects

For production applications, we recommend using the stable models from our [main model lineup](/models/overview).

## Current Beta Models

The following models are currently available in beta.

### Checking Beta Status via the API

You can check if a model is in beta by calling the [List Models](/api-reference/endpoint/models/list) endpoint. Beta models include a `betaModel` field set to `true` in their `model_spec`:

```json
{
  "id": "some-beta-model",
  "model_spec": {
    "name": "Some Beta Model",
    "betaModel": true,
    "privacy": "private"
  },
  "type": "text",
  "object": "model",
  "owned_by": "venice.ai"
}
```

You can check `if (model.model_spec.betaModel)` to identify beta models and warn users or handle them differently in your application.

## Join the Alpha Testing Program

Want to help shape Venice's future models and features? Join our alpha testing program to get early access to new models before they're released publicly, provide feedback that influences development, and help us validate performance at scale.
