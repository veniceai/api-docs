### Pro Users

Pro subscribers receive a one-time $10 API credit when upgrading to Pro. Use it to test and build small apps. You can scale your usage by buying credits, buying Diem, or staking VVV.

### Paid Tier

Choose how you pay for API usage:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Buy API Credits">
    Pay in USD via the [API Dashboard](https://venice.ai/settings/api). Credits are applied to usage automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Buy Diem (1 Diem = $1/day)">
    Purchase Diem directly. Each Diem grants $1 of compute per day at the same rates as USD.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stake to Earn Diem (1 Diem = $1/day)">
    Stake tokens to receive daily Diem allocations (each Diem grants $1 of compute per day). Manage staking and Diem at the [Token Dashboard](https://venice.ai/token).
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Model Pricing

All prices are in USD. Diem users pay the same rates (1 Diem = $1 of compute per day).

### Chat Models
