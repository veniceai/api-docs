### Web Search and Scraping

Web Search and Web Scraping features run on dedicated compute infrastructure designed for large-scale crawling and real-time content extraction. These features are usage-based and charged per API call when enabled:

| Feature | Venice Models | Other Models | Parameters |
|---------|:-------------:|:------------:|------------|
| Web Search | $10 / 1K calls | $25 / 1K calls | `enable_web_search: true` |
| Web Scraping | $10 / 1K calls | $25 / 1K calls | `enable_web_scraping: true` |

**Venice Models**: `venice-uncensored`, `qwen3-4b`, `mistral-31-24b`

<Info>
Web Scraping automatically detects up to 3 URLs per message, scrapes and converts content into structured markdown, and adds the extracted text into model context. These charges apply in addition to standard model token pricing.

### Video Models

Video pricing is dynamic and varies by model, resolution, and duration. See the [Video Models page](/models/video) for live quotes, or call the [Video Quote API](/api-reference/endpoint/video/quote) programmatically.
